# **1\. Executive Summary**

This document specifies the design, architecture, and evaluation strategy for KnowledgePilot - an Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built as a technical response to the AI Engineering interview assignment. The system demonstrates a step-change advancement beyond traditional RAG by enabling the model to reason about its own retrieval, self-correct when retrieved context is insufficient, and execute multi-hop queries through an explicit LangGraph-orchestrated state machine.

KnowledgePilot targets a multi-domain technical knowledge base (AI/ML research papers, software documentation, technical guides), a corpus chosen specifically to expose the failure modes of single-pass retrieval and justify every agentic design decision. The system is delivered as a working Streamlit prototype with full LangSmith observability and a structured evaluation framework.

## **1.1 What This System Demonstrates**

| **Capability**                | **How It Is Demonstrated**                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agentic Retrieval Loop**    | LangGraph graph with a Relevance Grader node that triggers re-query when retrieved chunks are insufficient - agent decides when to search again               |
| **Query Decomposition**       | Complex multi-hop questions are broken into sub-queries by a dedicated Decomposer node; each sub-query retrieves independently before final synthesis         |
| **Hybrid Retrieval**          | Dense vector search (FAISS/Chroma) combined with BM25 sparse retrieval via LangChain EnsembleRetriever; weighted fusion returns best-of-both results          |
| **Cross-Encoder Reranking**   | Top-K hybrid results re-scored by a sentence-transformers cross-encoder, elevating semantically precise chunks over vector-distance approximations            |
| **Citations with Provenance** | Every synthesized answer carries inline citations (\[¹\], \[²\]) linked to specific source chunks with page number, score, and which sub-query generated them |
| **LangSmith Observability**   | Full graph execution traced to LangSmith: retrieval scores, node transitions, LLM decisions, latency per step, and token counts all captured                  |
| **Automated Evaluation**      | LLM-as-Judge harness using RAGAS metrics (Faithfulness, Context Precision, Answer Relevancy) run against a golden dataset of 23 curated test cases           |
| **Tool-Using Agent**          | Planner node selects from a multi-tool action space (vector retrieval, web search, arxiv lookup) per query/sub-query; tool choice is justified, traceable, and citation-attributed by source_type |

# **2\. Domain Selection & Justification**

The recruiter specification did not mandate a domain, making domain choice a design decision that itself signals engineering judgment. The selected domain must satisfy three criteria: (1) it must expose the genuine limitations of traditional single-pass RAG so the agentic upgrades are clearly justified; (2) it must be realistically demoable with a publicly accessible corpus; and (3) it must reflect relevance to AI engineering roles.

## **2.1 Chosen Domain: Multi-Domain Technical Knowledge Base**

KnowledgePilot is built over a corpus combining three sub-collections:

- **AI/ML Research Papers - 10-15 curated papers from Arxiv (RAG, LLM, evaluation, agents topics)**
  - Why: Dense technical content with cross-paper references makes multi-hop queries natural (e.g. 'How does the reranking approach in Paper X differ from the fusion method described in Paper Y?')
- **Software/Framework Documentation - LangChain, LangGraph, FAISS official docs (HTML to text)**
  - Why: Exact keyword lookup (function names, parameter names) favours BM25 - justifies hybrid retrieval design
- **Technical How-To Guides & FAQs - curated Q&A style documents on RAG best practices**
  - Why: Short, factual chunks test retrieval precision vs. verbose synthesis

## **2.2 Why This Domain Justifies Agentic RAG**

| **Query Type**                                                                                                       | **Traditional RAG Failure**                                                             | **Agentic RAG Fix**                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Simple factual "What is HNSW indexing?"**                                                                          | One retrieval pass - works fine                                                         | Adaptive routing: detected as simple, skips decomposition                                                          |
| **Multi-hop "How does Paper X's chunking strategy compare to Paper Y's, and what do the LangChain docs recommend?"** | Single embedding misses cross-document comparison; answer is partial or hallucinated    | Decomposer splits into 3 sub-queries, retrieves each independently, synthesizer combines with citations per source |
| **Terminology-exact "What is the default chunk_overlap in RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter?"**                         | Semantic search may retrieve related but imprecise chunks; misses exact parameter value | Hybrid BM25 retrieves exact keyword match; cross-encoder confirms relevance; precise answer                        |
| **Insufficient context "Summarise the experimental results from the RAGAS paper"**                                   | Top-K may miss key results tables deep in the document                                  | Relevance Grader detects low-quality chunks; agent re-queries with refined query; iterates up to N times           |

# **3\. Traditional RAG vs. Agentic RAG**

Understanding the architectural delta between traditional and agentic RAG is the conceptual foundation of this system. This section maps the comparison concretely and positions each agentic upgrade against a specific limitation of the pipeline built in the prior Residex/DocuMind project.

## **3.1 Side-by-Side Architecture Comparison**

| **Dimension**          | **Traditional RAG (DocuMind)**                                   | **Agentic RAG (KnowledgePilot)**                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retrieval passes**   | Single pass per query - fixed                                    | Dynamic: 1-N passes based on Relevance Grader verdict                                                                   |
| **Query handling**     | Query embedded as-is                                             | Complexity classifier → optional decomposition into sub-queries                                                         |
| **Retrieval strategy** | Dense vector search (Firestore Vector Search) only               | Hybrid: Dense (FAISS) + Sparse (BM25) → EnsembleRetriever → Cross-Encoder Reranker                                      |
| **Action space**       | Single action: query the vector DB                                | Multi-tool: vector retrieval, web search (Tavily), arxiv lookup. Planner node selects tool(s) per (sub-)query; agent decides *if*, *when*, and *where* to search |
| **Self-correction**    | None - first retrieved chunks used regardless of quality         | Relevance Grader LLM node evaluates chunks; triggers re-query with refined terms if quality insufficient                |
| **Orchestration**      | LangGraph with deterministic intent gate and category checkpoint | LangGraph with adaptive routing: simple path vs. decomposition path vs. iterative retrieval loop                        |
| **Citations**          | Citation model per chunk (doc_id, filename, page, snippet)       | Multi-hop provenance: inline citations (\[¹\]) mapped to specific sub-query + chunk, with confidence score per citation |
| **Observability**      | Print statements / Firestore session logs                        | LangSmith full-graph tracing: every node, LLM call, retrieval score, and latency captured                               |
| **Evaluation**         | Manual 12-case golden dataset, human grading                     | Automated: RAGAS metrics (Faithfulness, Context Precision, Answer Relevancy) with LLM-as-Judge; 23 golden cases including tool-selection and re-planning tests |

## **3.2 Why Agentic RAG - The Honest Trade-offs**

**Agentic RAG is not universally better - it is better when queries are complex and variable. The system routes simple queries through the fast path to avoid unnecessary overhead.**

| **Agentic RAG Advantages**                                                 | **Agentic RAG Trade-offs**                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Handles multi-hop queries that single-pass fails                           | Higher latency for complex queries (2-4x single-pass)                       |
| Self-corrects on poor retrieval - higher answer quality for hard questions | More complex graph to debug and maintain                                    |
| Adaptive: routes simple queries through a fast path (near-zero overhead)   | Token usage scales with iterations - higher LLM cost per complex query      |
| Hybrid retrieval captures both semantic and keyword relevance              | Reranker adds ~100-300ms latency (mitigated by async execution)             |
| Full observability via LangSmith - every decision is inspectable           | LangSmith requires API key and adds tracing overhead (~10ms per trace call) |

# **4\. System Architecture**

## **4.1 High-Level Architecture**

KnowledgePilot is implemented as a LangGraph StateGraph that realises the canonical agentic loop **Query → Plan → Act → Evaluate → Iterate → Generate**. It has eight functional nodes, an adaptive router with four classification outcomes, a multi-tool action space, and a maximum-iteration guard. Conversation queries short-circuit at Node 1.5; simple queries skip decomposition and go directly to the Planner; complex/multi-hop queries pass through the Decomposer first; insufficient retrievals loop back through the Planner with a different tool strategy.

## **4.2 LangGraph State Schema**

The AgentState TypedDict persists all information across node transitions:

| **Field**              | **Type**                              | **Purpose**                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **query**              | str                                   | Original user query, immutable through the graph             |
| **query_complexity**   | Literal\[conversation, simple, complex, multi_hop\] | Set by Node 1; routes to Conversation Responder (conversation), Planner directly (simple), or Decomposer (complex/multi-hop) |
| **sub_queries**        | List\[str\]                           | Populated by Query Decomposer; empty list for simple queries |
| **action_plan**        | List\[ToolCall\]                      | Set by Planner; each ToolCall = (tool_name, args, sub_query, rationale). Re-written on Iterate |
| **tool_results**       | Dict\[str, List\[Evidence\]\]         | Evidence accumulated by source_type (vector_chunk / web / arxiv); deduped by content hash |
| **relevance_verdict**  | Literal\[sufficient, insufficient\]   | Set by Relevance Grader over *all* Evidence (not just chunks); triggers re-plan or proceed |
| **iteration_count**    | int                                   | Guards against infinite plan-act-evaluate loops (max_iterations=3) |
| **answer**             | str                                   | Synthesized answer with inline citation markers              |
| **citations**          | List\[Citation\]                      | Rich citation objects linked to specific Evidence items, with source_type |
| **hallucination_flag** | bool                                  | Set by Hallucination Guard if answer claims outside Evidence |

**Evidence object** (unified across tools): `{evidence_id, source_type, content, metadata, dense_score?, rerank_score?, url?, page?}`. The Action Executor wraps every tool's raw output in this shape so downstream nodes (Grader, Synthesizer, Guard) are tool-agnostic.

## **4.3 Node Specifications**

### **Node 1 - Query Analyzer**

Uses an LLM with a structured JSON output schema to classify every incoming query into one of four labels. Outputs query_complexity and a list of key entities. Classification is deliberately conservative - **conversation** requires explicit social/meta signals; otherwise the Analyzer falls back to **simple** rather than risk refusing a real factual question. Only **multi-hop** triggers decomposition; **complex** uses a single retrieval with a higher top-K. This prevents over-decomposition of within-document multi-concept queries.

- Conversation: Pure social input or meta-questions about the assistant itself - no retrieval needed. Triggers: greeting/farewell lexicon ('hi', 'hello', 'hey', 'thanks', 'bye', 'good morning'); meta-questions ('who are you', 'what can you do', 'how do you work'); social text ('how's it going', 'nice to meet you'). **Hard requirement**: zero domain entities AND zero factual question-words ('what is', 'how does', 'define', 'explain', 'compare'). If unsure, fall back to *simple* - a wasted retrieval is cheaper than refusing to answer a real question. Routes to Node 1.5 Conversation Responder; bypasses retrieval and Hallucination Guard entirely.
- Simple: Single-concept factual question answerable from one chunk; zero comparison conjunctions ('and', 'vs', 'compare', 'differ', 'relate'). Example: 'What is cosine similarity?' Routes directly to the Planner (skips Decomposer).
- Complex: Multi-concept question whose concepts plausibly co-occur in the same document or sub-domain. Example: 'What is HNSW and how does FAISS implement it?' - both concepts live in the same doc neighbourhood, so a single retrieval with top-K=8 suffices.
- Multi-hop: Explicit cross-source signal required - comparison verbs ('compare', 'differ', 'versus') AND named entities from different sub-corpora, or phrasing like 'according to X and Y'. Example: 'How does the chunking in the RAGAS paper differ from the LangChain default?'

### **Node 1.5 - Conversation Responder (conversation only)**

Short-circuits the retrieval and synthesis pipeline for pure social interaction, greeting, and meta-questions about the assistant. Implemented as a hybrid strategy to balance cost and naturalness:

**Hybrid template + LLM approach:**

- **Greetings/Farewells** (lexicon match: 'hi', 'hello', 'hey', 'thanks', 'bye', 'good morning', 'goodbye', 'see you'): Respond with a lightweight canned template + one example query
  - Example: 'Hi! I can help you with questions about AI/ML papers, LangChain docs, and RAG best practices. Try asking: "What is cosine similarity?" or "How does hybrid retrieval work?"'
  - Cost: ~0ms, zero hallucination risk

- **Meta-questions** (lexicon match: 'who are you', 'what can you do', 'how do you work', 'what are you', 'tell me about yourself'): Respond with a single LLM call with a tight, scope-bounded system prompt
  - System instruction: 'You are a helpful assistant. Answer only about your actual capabilities: answering factual questions about AI/ML papers, LangChain/LangGraph/FAISS documentation, and RAG best practices. Do not hallucinate capabilities or promise to do things outside this scope. Be concise (2-3 sentences).'
  - This prevents the common failure mode where the assistant over-promises capabilities
  - Cost: 1 LLM call (~0.5s), grounds response in actual system capabilities

**Output:** Plain text response with no citations, no retrieval, no Hallucination Guard check.

**Design rationale:** Conversation detection fires on explicit signals only; falling back to *simple* is preferred when uncertain. This node exists to avoid wasting retrieval + ranking on pure social input, which is a real-world failure mode ("here are some documents about greetings"). The hybrid approach avoids a full LLM call on high-volume greeting input while preserving naturalness on meta-questions where the LLM's response reflects actual capabilities.

### **Node 2 - Query Decomposer (complex / multi-hop only)**

**Fires only when query_complexity is 'complex' or 'multi-hop'.** Skipped entirely for 'conversation' (handled by Node 1.5) and 'simple' (handled by Planner directly).

Prompts an LLM to break the original query into 2-3 atomic sub-queries (hard cap at 3). Each sub-query is independently retrievable and collectively sufficient to answer the original. Design constraint: sub-queries must be non-overlapping to avoid duplicate chunk retrieval.

**Decomposition Sanity Gate.** After generation, sub-queries pass through a deterministic validation step before retrieval fires:

- If only 1 sub-query is produced → skip decomposition, fall back to single-retrieval path
- If pairwise token overlap between any two sub-queries exceeds 70% (Jaccard on lowercased tokens minus stopwords) → reject decomposition, fall back to single retrieval
- If sub-queries collectively drop a named entity present in the original query → log warning and append the entity to the most relevant sub-query

This gate prevents the highest-cost failure mode: paying 3x retrieval latency for sub-queries that retrieve overlapping chunks.

- Example: 'How does the chunking strategy in the RAG paper compare to LangChain's default?' decomposes into:
  - 'What chunking strategy does the RAGAS paper recommend?'
  - 'What is LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter default configuration?'
  - 'How do fixed vs. recursive chunking strategies affect retrieval recall?'

### **Node 2.5 - Planner (the *Plan* stage of the agent loop)**

The Planner is what makes this system *agentic* in the broad sense - it decides **if**, **when**, and **where** to search. For each (sub-)query it selects an ordered set of tool calls from the action space, with a written rationale per call. The Planner is an LLM with a structured JSON output schema and access to tool descriptions but not tool implementations.

**Action space (initial, extensible):**

| **Tool** | **When to select** | **Returns** |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| **vector_retriever** | Default for in-corpus knowledge: AI/ML papers, LangChain/LangGraph/FAISS docs, curated FAQs. Always tried first unless a hard out-of-corpus signal is present. | Top-K reranked chunks from FAISS+BM25+CrossEncoder pipeline |
| **web_search** (Tavily) | Temporal markers ('latest', 'recent', '2026', 'newest', 'current'); query references entities not in corpus; or vector_retriever returned 0 RELEVANT evidence in a prior iteration | Top-5 web results: title, URL, snippet, published_date |
| **arxiv_search** | Query mentions a paper title or arxiv ID not present in the local corpus; query asks for a paper's abstract/authors/year that isn't pre-indexed | Paper metadata + abstract for up to 3 matches |

**Selection policy (deterministic guards on top of LLM choice):**

- Default action for any (sub-)query is `vector_retriever` - LLM must justify deviating
- `web_search` is gated behind: temporal regex match OR prior-iteration insufficient verdict OR Analyzer flagged `out_of_corpus=true`
- `arxiv_search` is gated behind: regex match for arxiv ID (`\d{4}\.\d{4,5}`) OR named-paper-not-in-corpus signal
- Hard cap: ≤2 tool calls per sub-query per iteration to bound cost

**Planner output schema (per ToolCall):** `{tool_name, args, sub_query, rationale, expected_evidence_type}`. The rationale is logged to LangSmith so tool selection is fully inspectable - if a wrong tool fires, the trace shows *why*.

**Re-planning on iterate:** when the Relevance Grader returns `insufficient`, control returns to the Planner (not directly to Node 3). The Planner sees what the previous iteration tried, and is prompted to *change strategy* - typically by switching tool (e.g. vector → web_search) or refining the query - rather than retrying the same call. This is the single most important agentic property of the system: the agent reasons about its own past actions before acting again.

### **Node 3 - Action Executor (the *Act* stage; was Hybrid Retriever)**

The Action Executor dispatches each ToolCall in the plan, normalises raw tool output into a unified Evidence object, and accumulates results into `tool_results` keyed by source_type. Tool implementations:

**vector_retriever** (the primary retrieval optimization layer, four stages):

- Stage 1 - Dense Retrieval: Query embedding via sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim), FAISS IndexFlatIP for cosine similarity, top-20 candidates
- Stage 2 - Sparse Retrieval: BM25Retriever (LangChain) over the same corpus, top-20 candidates. BM25 excels at exact keyword matches (function names, parameter names, paper titles)
- Stage 3 - Ensemble Fusion: EnsembleRetriever with weights \[0.6 dense, 0.4 sparse\], Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) combining ranked lists from both retrievers, returning top-15
- Stage 4 - Cross-Encoder Reranking: sentence-transformers/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 scores all 15 candidates against the query; top-5 selected by cross-encoder score (not vector distance)

**Why cross-encoder reranking? Bi-encoder vector similarity is an approximation - it compares query and document independently. A cross-encoder reads both jointly, producing a true relevance score at the cost of latency. Applied only on the top-15 pre-filtered candidates, it adds ~200ms while lifting Precision@1 by 8-15% in practice.**

**web_search**: Tavily Search API (`search_depth=advanced`, `max_results=5`). Each result is wrapped as Evidence with `source_type='web'`, `url`, `published_date`, and `content=snippet`. No bi-encoder/rerank scores apply; relevance is judged downstream by Node 4.

**arxiv_search**: arxiv API (`max_results=3`). Each paper wrapped as Evidence with `source_type='arxiv'`, `arxiv_id`, `title`, `authors`, `published`, and `content=abstract`.

**Cross-tool deduplication**: Evidence items are hashed on `(source_type, normalised_content[:200])` to prevent duplicate evidence when web and vector return overlapping content (e.g. arxiv abstract vs. local paper chunk).

**Failure handling**: if a tool errors (network timeout, API quota), the Executor logs the failure to LangSmith and the Planner is re-invoked to choose an alternative - the agent does not crash on a single tool failure.

### **Node 4 - Relevance Grader (the *Evaluate* stage)**

For each Evidence item (regardless of source_type), an LLM is prompted with: 'Given the query \[Q\], rate this evidence \[E\] as: RELEVANT, PARTIAL, or IRRELEVANT.' Evidence count is aggregated across all tools. If fewer than 3 RELEVANT items are found and iteration_count < max_iterations:

- Verdict is set to `insufficient` and control returns to the **Planner** (not Node 3 directly)
- The Planner receives the prior plan, the prior verdict, and which tools have been tried, and is prompted to *change strategy* - typically switch tools (e.g. add `web_search` after vector_retriever produced thin evidence) or refine the query
- New Evidence is merged with existing relevant Evidence (deduplication by content hash)
- iteration_count is incremented; the loop terminates at max_iterations=3 even if still insufficient (Synthesizer then produces a low-confidence answer)

### **Node 5 - Answer Synthesizer**

Constructs the final prompt with: (1) system instructions for citation-grounded answering, (2) numbered context blocks for each relevant chunk, (3) citation instruction: reference chunks inline as \[¹\], \[²\], etc. Output is plain text with inline citation markers.

### **Node 6 - Hallucination Guard**

**Skipped on conversation path** - no retrieval occurred, so citation grounding checks are inapplicable. Guard fires only after synthesis on complex/simple/multi-hop queries.

Post-generation safety check, implemented as a **deterministic citation-grounding validator** rather than a separate LLM call. Runtime LLM verifiers double answer latency and largely re-check what a well-prompted Synthesizer already enforces; a deterministic check catches the highest-frequency failure mode (uncited or mis-cited claims) at near-zero cost. Deeper semantic faithfulness is measured offline via RAGAS Faithfulness on the golden dataset (see §7).

The guard validates three properties:

- **Citation coverage**: every sentence containing a factual claim (heuristic: contains a number, named entity, or technical term) must include at least one citation marker
- **Citation validity**: every inline marker `[ⁿ]` in the answer must reference a chunk_id that was actually present in retrieved_chunks
- **Citation alignment**: each cited chunk's snippet must share ≥1 content token (excluding stopwords) with the sentence it supports

If any check fails, hallucination_flag is set true and the system returns a degraded response noting low confidence rather than a potentially wrong answer. The LLM-based verifier is retained as an optional fallback that fires only when relevance_verdict was 'insufficient' at the final iteration - i.e. defense in depth on risk signals, not on every query.

## **4.4 Reference Architecture - Patterns from DocuMind**

The DocuMind system (Residex's property document Q&A feature) established a working LangGraph orchestration pattern that KnowledgePilot directly builds upon. The design decisions below are proven in production and carried forward.

### **Component Relationship Map**

```
DocuMindService  (facade / API boundary)
│
│  creates & injects
├─► ConversationRouter        (LLM node: conversation vs. RAG intent)
├─► CategoryPredictor         (LLM node: which document category to search)
│
│  injects both nodes into
└─► DocuMindGraphOrchestrator (LangGraph StateGraph)
         │
         │  compiled graph nodes
         ├─ route_conversation    → calls ConversationRouter.route()
         ├─ respond_conversation  → emits action=conversation
         ├─ predict_categories    → calls CategoryPredictor.predict()
         ├─ decide_action         → deterministic logic (explicit / confirm / cancel / predict)
         ├─ prepare_confirmation  → emits action=ask_confirmation
         ├─ prepare_cancel        → emits action=cancel
         └─ prepare_retrieve      → emits action=retrieve (passes through)

ConversationStore  (Firestore-backed session memory, used by Service only, not injected into graph)
    ├─ get_or_create_session()
    ├─ append_turn()
    ├─ set_pending_confirmation() / get_pending_confirmation() / clear_pending_confirmation()
    └─ in-memory cache layer over Firestore reads
```

### **Key Design Patterns (Carry Forward into KnowledgePilot)**

| **Pattern** | **DocuMind Implementation** | **How It Applies to KnowledgePilot** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dependency injection into graph** | `DocuMindGraphOrchestrator(conversation_router=..., category_predictor=...)` | Each LangGraph node is a class injected into the orchestrator — nodes are testable in isolation without wiring the full graph |
| **TypedDict state schema** | `DocuMindState(TypedDict, total=False)` carries all fields across node transitions | `AgentState` TypedDict (§4.2) is the same pattern; every node reads from and writes to the shared typed state dict |
| **Graph owns routing, Service owns retrieval** | Graph emits `action=retrieve` or `action=conversation`; Service executes the actual Firestore vector query and LLM synthesis after graph returns | Graph (nodes 1-6) decides *what to do* and produces Evidence; Service owns indexing, persistence, and the final API response shape |
| **Checkpoint / confirmation pattern** | Graph emits `action=ask_confirmation`; Service persists pending state in `ConversationStore.set_pending_confirmation()`; next request resolves it via `user_action=confirm/cancel/override` | Relevance Grader → re-plan loop is the agentic equivalent: graph state holds iteration context across the plan-act-evaluate cycle without external state |
| **Two-layer routing** | Layer 1: `ConversationRouter` (conversation vs. document intent) → Layer 2: `CategoryPredictor` (which categories to search) | Layer 1: `QueryAnalyzer` (conversation / simple / complex / multi-hop) → Layer 2: `Planner` (which tools to call, which sub-queries to run) |
| **LLM node + keyword fallback** | Both `ConversationRouter` and `CategoryPredictor` have `except Exception` blocks with keyword-based fallback logic | Every LLM node should define deterministic fallback behaviour so a single LLM failure does not crash the entire graph |
| **Async graph execution** | `await self._graph.ainvoke(state)` — graph compiled and stored at init; reused per request | Same pattern: graph compiled once at service init, `ainvoke` per request |
| **Session memory decoupled from graph** | `ConversationStore` is instantiated in `DocuMindService.__init__`, not inside the graph; graph is stateless between requests | `ConversationStore` (or equivalent LangSmith/LangGraph Checkpointer) lives in the service layer, not inside node implementations |

### **Structural Lessons from DocuMind**

**What worked well:**
- Compiling the graph once at service init and reusing it avoids re-building the StateGraph on every request — critical for latency
- Keeping node classes (ConversationRouter, CategoryPredictor) independent of the StateGraph means they can be unit-tested with a mock LLM without spinning up the full graph
- The `DocuMindState` TypedDict with `total=False` allows nodes to incrementally add fields without breaking earlier nodes that don't set them
- Structured string parsing (`intent=...;rag_needed=...;confidence=...`) as LLM output format is simpler and more robust than JSON for small structured outputs in lightweight nodes

**What KnowledgePilot improves:**
- DocuMind nodes communicate via free-text LLM responses parsed with string splitting; KnowledgePilot nodes (Analyzer, Planner, Grader) use structured JSON output schema via `with_structured_output()` for stronger contracts
- DocuMind has no iteration loop — the graph terminates after one routing decision; KnowledgePilot adds the plan-act-evaluate-iterate cycle with `iteration_count` guard in AgentState
- DocuMind's ConversationStore uses Firestore directly; KnowledgePilot uses LangSmith as the persistence + observability layer

---

### **Proposed File Structure**

LangGraph node implementations are moved into a dedicated `nodes/` subfolder under `rag/`, mirroring the pattern where each node is a standalone, injectable class. The service and orchestrator remain at the `rag/` level.

**Node class contract** (same pattern as DocuMind's ConversationRouter and CategoryPredictor):

```python
# Each node in rag/nodes/ follows this interface:
class QueryAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, llm):          # LLM injected at service init
        self._llm = llm

    async def run(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        # reads from state, returns updated state dict
        ...

# Injected into orchestrator at construction time:
class KnowledgePilotGraphOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, query_analyzer, conversation_responder, planner, ...):
        self._query_analyzer = query_analyzer
        ...
        self._graph = self._build_graph()   # compiled once at init, reused per request
```

# **5\. Citation Handling Design**

Citations are a first-class feature and a bonus requirement. KnowledgePilot's citation design builds on the DocuMind citation model and adds multi-hop provenance tracking: each citation is traceable back to the specific sub-query that generated its retrieval, the retrieval scores from both bi-encoder and cross-encoder stages, and the chunk's exact position within the source document.

## **5.1 Citation Data Model**

| **Field**            | **Type**    | **Description**                                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **citation_id**      | str         | Inline marker index (1, 2, 3 … matched to \[¹\] in answer text)      |
| **source_type**      | Literal\[vector_chunk, web, arxiv\] | Which tool produced the underlying Evidence; drives citation rendering and trust badges |
| **evidence_id**      | str         | Unique identifier for the specific Evidence item retrieved (chunk_id, URL hash, or arxiv_id) |
| **source_document**  | str         | Filename, web page title, or paper title (e.g. 'ragas_paper.pdf', 'OpenAI Blog: o5 Reasoning') |
| **url**              | str \| None | Web URL or arxiv link; None for local vector_chunk citations         |
| **page_number**      | int \| None | Page within source document; None for web/arxiv sources              |
| **section_title**    | str \| None | Nearest section heading above the chunk (if extractable)             |
| **snippet**          | str         | 80-120 character excerpt - the most relevant sentence                |
| **dense_score**      | float \| None | Bi-encoder cosine similarity from FAISS (0-1); None for web/arxiv  |
| **rerank_score**     | float \| None | Cross-encoder relevance score; None for web/arxiv (no rerank applied) |
| **published_date**   | str \| None | For web/arxiv sources only - critical for temporal queries          |
| **sub_query_origin** | str \| None | Which sub-query caused this Evidence to be retrieved (for multi-hop) |
| **tool_rationale**   | str         | Why the Planner selected this tool for this sub-query (for inspectability) |
| **iteration**        | int         | Which plan-act-evaluate iteration produced this Evidence (1, 2, or 3) |

## **5.2 Inline Citation Format**

Answer text uses numeric superscript markers generated by the Synthesizer prompt instruction. Each marker links to a citation panel rendered below the answer:

**Example answer output with citations:**

The RAGAS framework evaluates RAG pipelines using four metrics: Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy, Context Precision, and Context Recall \[¹\]. Faithfulness is defined as the proportion of claims in the generated answer that are supported by the retrieved context \[¹\], while Answer Relevancy measures whether the response addresses the original question \[²\].

── Citations ────────────────────────────────────────────

\[¹\] ragas_paper.pdf · p.3 · Section: 'Evaluation Metrics' · Score: 0.92

Sub-query: 'What metrics does RAGAS define?' · Iteration 1

Snippet: '...faithfulness is computed as the number of supported claims...'

\[²\] ragas_paper.pdf · p.4 · Section: 'Answer Relevancy' · Score: 0.88

Sub-query: 'How is Answer Relevancy computed in RAGAS?' · Iteration 1

## **5.3 Citation Quality vs. DocuMind**

DocuMind citations (Citation model: doc_id, filename, category, page, snippet, score) were a strong foundation. KnowledgePilot advances them in three ways:

- Multi-hop provenance: sub_query_origin field traces each citation to the specific sub-query that surfaced it - critical for multi-hop answers where different parts of the answer come from different retrieval passes
- Dual scoring: both dense_score and rerank_score are exposed, making it inspectable whether a chunk ranked highly because of semantic similarity or cross-encoder relevance - useful for debugging and trust calibration
- Inline integration: citation markers are generated inside the answer text by the LLM (not appended post-hoc), enabling per-claim attribution rather than per-response attribution

# **6\. Retrieval Optimisation**

## **6.1 Hybrid Search Architecture**

The core retrieval upgrade over traditional single-mode dense search is the EnsembleRetriever combining dense and sparse signals. The motivation for each component:

| **Component**                                        | **Strength**                                                                        | **Weakness (compensated by other)**                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dense FAISS (semantic vector search)**             | Captures meaning and paraphrase; finds relevant chunks even when exact terms differ | Misses exact technical terms (class names, error codes, parameter names) - 'chunk_overlap' might rank lower than semantically similar text |
| **Sparse BM25 (keyword matching)**                   | Exact term matching; first-pass recall for technical jargon and precise queries     | Ignores semantic meaning; 'batch size' and 'mini-batch size' are unrelated terms to BM25                                                   |
| **Cross-Encoder Reranker (joint relevance scoring)** | Reads query and chunk jointly - true relevance, not distance approximation          | Slow: cannot run over full corpus; only applied to top-15 from fusion                                                                      |

## **6.2 Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**

EnsembleRetriever combines ranked lists from dense and sparse retrievers using RRF. For each document d across both ranked lists:

**RRF_score(d) = Σ weight_i / (k + rank_i(d))**

where k=60 (smoothing constant), rank_i(d) is d's rank in retriever i, weight_i ∈ {0.6 dense, 0.4 sparse}

Documents appearing in both ranked lists accumulate score from both - a natural document-level AND gate

## **6.3 Chunking Strategy**

Chunking strategy is a first-order retrieval quality variable. KnowledgePilot uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with parameters tuned per document type:

| **Document Type**                  | **chunk_size** | **chunk_overlap** | **Rationale**                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Research papers (PDF)**          | 1000 tokens    | 150 tokens        | Dense academic text; larger chunks preserve methodological context           |
| **Technical documentation (HTML)** | 600 tokens     | 100 tokens        | Sections tend to be modular; smaller chunks improve precision for API lookup |
| **FAQ / How-To guides**            | 400 tokens     | 80 tokens         | Q&A pairs are naturally atomic; tight chunks = precise retrieval             |

## **6.4 Performance Targets**

| **Metric**                   | **Baseline (dense only)** | **Target (hybrid + rerank)** | **Measurement Method**                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Precision@1**              | ~70%                      | **\>85%**                    | Golden dataset ground truth comparison  |
| **Precision@3**              | ~88%                      | **\>95%**                    | Golden dataset, correct doc in top-3    |
| **RAGAS Faithfulness**       | N/A (new metric)          | **\>0.85**                   | LLM-as-judge on 23 test cases           |
| **RAGAS Context Precision**  | N/A                       | **\>0.80**                   | LLM-as-judge on 23 test cases           |
| **Answer latency (simple)**  | <2s target                | **<2s**                      | Streamlit app wall-clock time           |
| **Answer latency (complex)** | <8s target                | **<8s**                      | Multi-hop with reranking, Streamlit app |

# **7\. Evaluation Framework & Test Cases**

The evaluation strategy addresses the recruiter's explicit requirement ('explain test cases built to assure quality') and the checklist gap identified from DocuMind: no automated LLM-as-judge, no RAGAS metrics, no regression gates. KnowledgePilot closes all three gaps.

## **7.1 Evaluation Architecture**

- **LangSmith as Tracing + Evaluation Platform: Every graph execution creates a LangSmith run with all node inputs/outputs logged. Golden dataset test cases are stored as LangSmith datasets and evaluated with built-in and custom evaluators.**
- **RAGAS Metrics (automated, LLM-as-judge):**
  - Faithfulness: Is the answer supported by the retrieved context? (cross-checks each claim)
  - Context Precision: Of the retrieved chunks, what fraction were actually useful for the answer?
  - Answer Relevancy: Does the answer address the user's original question?
  - Context Recall: Were all relevant chunks retrieved? (requires ground truth)
- **Manual golden dataset: 23 curated test cases (expanded from DocuMind's 12) with expected answers, expected source documents, expected citation documents, and - for tool-selection cases - expected tool_name in the Planner trace.**

## **7.2 Golden Test Dataset (23 Cases)**

Test cases are designed to cover all query complexity levels, all agentic capabilities (including tool selection and re-planning), and all known failure modes of traditional RAG. Cases T18, T21, T22, T23 specifically validate the tool-using agent loop - they fail by construction on a vector-only system:

| **#**   | **Complexity** | **Test Query**                                                                                                                                     | **Tests For**                                             | **Pass Criteria**                                                                                                     |

## **7.3 LangSmith Integration Plan**

- Dataset creation: Upload all 23 test cases as a LangSmith Dataset with input, expected_output, expected_sources, and expected_tool_calls fields
- Run evaluation: use client.evaluate() to run the Agentic RAG chain over the dataset with RAGAS evaluators as LangSmith custom evaluators
- Custom evaluators registered:
  - faithfulness_evaluator: LLM-as-judge checking if answer claims are grounded in retrieved Evidence
  - citation_accuracy_evaluator: verifies inline citation markers correspond to cited sources, and that source_type is correct
  - tool_selection_evaluator: for tool-selection test cases, asserts the Planner's `action_plan` includes the expected tool_name (e.g. T18 must include `web_search`)
  - re_retrieval_counter: counts how many test cases triggered re-planning and computes average iterations + tool-switch rate
- Tracing: every Streamlit demo run produces a LangSmith trace URL, shown in the UI sidebar for inspector access during the demo

- Type a simple query: 'What is cosine similarity?' - show: fast path, 1 retrieval, no decomposition, 1 citation.
- Type a multi-hop query: 'How does the chunking in the RAGAS paper differ from LangChain's default, and does the reranker account for this?' - show: complexity = multi-hop, 3 sub-queries in sidebar, 2 retrieval iterations if triggered, citations from 2+ sources.
- Expand the Retrieved Chunks panel - explain dual scores (dense vs. rerank), show the Relevance Grade column.
- Click the LangSmith Trace URL - show the interviewer the full graph trace in LangSmith (live demo of observability).
- Run the Evaluation tab - show RAGAS scores for the 23 test cases; highlight Faithfulness > 0.85 and tool-selection accuracy on T18, T21, T22, T23.

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| **Phase 1 Foundation**     | Corpus + Ingestion Pipeline           | • Collect 10-15 AI/ML papers + LangChain docs<br><br>• Chunking (per-type strategy) + metadata tagging<br><br>• BM25 index + FAISS index built and persisted                               | 4-6 hrs         |
| **Phase 2 Core Retrieval** | Hybrid Retriever + Reranker working   | • EnsembleRetriever (FAISS + BM25)<br><br>• Cross-encoder reranker integration<br><br>• Unit test: hybrid vs. dense-only precision comparison on 10 queries                                | 6-8 hrs         |
| **Phase 3 Agentic Graph**  | LangGraph 7-node graph functional     | • Query Analyzer, Decomposer, Relevance Grader nodes<br><br>• Plan-Act-Evaluate-Iterate loop with max_iterations guard<br><br>• Deterministic Hallucination Guard<br><br>• LangSmith tracing connected | 8-10 hrs        |
| **Phase 3.5 Tool Integration** | Multi-tool action space + Planner | • Planner node with structured JSON ToolCall output schema<br><br>• Action Executor dispatcher; Evidence object normaliser<br><br>• Tool implementations: Tavily web_search, arxiv_search<br><br>• Re-planning on insufficient verdict (tool switch, not just query refine)<br><br>• Cross-tool Evidence dedup by content hash | 6-8 hrs         |
| **Phase 4 Citations**      | Inline citation system end-to-end     | • Citation model with source_type + URL + published_date<br><br>• Synthesizer prompt for inline markers across all source types<br><br>• Citation panel rendering with per-source-type badges in Streamlit<br><br>• Multi-hop provenance (sub_query_origin + tool_rationale fields)                             | 3-4 hrs         |
| **Phase 5 Evaluation**     | Golden dataset + RAGAS automated eval | • 23 test cases authored + stored as LangSmith dataset (incl. T18/T21/T22/T23 tool cases)<br><br>• RAGAS + tool_selection_evaluator + citation_accuracy_evaluator registered in LangSmith<br><br>• Frozen-cache mode for web_search/arxiv to make eval reproducible<br><br>• Evaluation tab in Streamlit                                              | 4-5 hrs         |
| **Phase 6 Demo Polish**    | Submission-ready Streamlit demo       | • Sidebar with complexity badge, sub-queries, action plan view, iteration counter, tool-switch indicator<br><br>• Query examples pre-loaded (incl. tool-selection examples)<br><br>• README with architecture diagram and evaluation results                        | 2-3 hrs         |

**Total estimated effort: 33-44 hours for a complete, submission-ready demo. Phase 1-3.5 are the MVP for a tool-using agentic prototype; Phase 4 adds end-to-end citations across source_types. Phases 5-6 deliver the evaluation framework and polish that differentiate the submission. Phase 3.5 (tool integration) is what elevates this from "smart RAG pipeline" to "tool-using agent" and is non-negotiable for the agentic-RAG framing.**

# **11\. Submission Differentiators**

This section maps each recruiter requirement to how this system addresses it, and identifies where it goes beyond the minimum requirement.
